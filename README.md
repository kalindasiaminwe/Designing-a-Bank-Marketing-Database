This is my solution to [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1613)'s project: Designing a Bank Marketing Database; which involved cleaning and structuring csv data using Python to enable the creation of a postgreSQL database to hold information about bank marketing campaigns.

Technology used: Python and PostgreSQL.
